# This is just a test

I really hope this just works.

Does code highlighting work?

``` haskell Fibonacci
fib :: Integer -> Integer
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
```

OoOoOo. This is pretty.

## What are some other cool features?

Sometimes my good looks make all the girls cry.
{% endblockquote %}

Hmmm. I am not in love with the way quotes look with this theme. Might
have to work some css magic.

## For the most part, I dig it
